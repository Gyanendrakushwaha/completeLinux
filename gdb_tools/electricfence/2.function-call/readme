the lefence would be able to rectify the overrun and underrun separately without any issue but if we run both overrun and underun with diff output files then lefence would perform single task only and next would be overrided 
to solve this issue we set something
cmd:- export EF_PROJECT_BELOW=1
then compile:- gcc -g underrun.c -o under -lefence
:- ./under
