here size is 5 of memory intialize 
but in loop we started from 0 and we are going backward using -- means this will be underrun


here normal gcc and gdb would not be able to rectifiy this bug and it will overrite in lowerboundry regions
 then compile:- gcc -g underrun.c -o underrun 
 then:- ./underrun
 
 
although lefence is used for heap memory bugs but at one time it is capable for overrun or underrun, to again rectifie this underrun by lefence we have to set something
in cmd:- export EF_PROJECT_BELOW=1
 
 then compile:- gcc -g underrun.c -o underrun -lefence
 then:- ./underrun
 
 as expected he output will show only one print statement
